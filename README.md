## Introduction

AI_Builder simplifies the machine learning workflow by providing templates, automated configuration, and seamless integration with popular ML libraries. It supports everything from data preprocessing to model deployment, making it an ideal tool for developers and data scientists who want to accelerate AI development.

AI_Builder comes pre-configured with powerful libraries like:
- **TensorFlow**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Dash**
- **Streamlit**

This ensures that you can hit the ground running without spending hours setting up dependencies or configuring environments.

## Features

- **Automated Model Creation**: AI_Builder offers pre-built templates for common machine learning tasks, enabling you to create models with minimal code.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Modify the default configurations to suit your specific needs, whether it’s adjusting training parameters or integrating custom datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Built-in functions for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrates with popular machine learning frameworks and APIs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Use visualizations through Dash or Streamlit to interactively monitor model performance and make real-time adjustments.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports deployment on local machines, Docker containers, or cloud platforms.
- **Python-first Development**: Optimized for Python-based machine learning development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using AI_Builder, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **Virtualenv** (recommended for environment management)

You can install Python and Git with the following commands (if you’re on macOS, use `brew`):

```bash
brew install python
brew install git
```

For Docker, follow the instructions from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Installation

Follow these steps to install AI_Builder:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai_builder.git
   cd ai_builder
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   It’s recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ai_builder_env
   source ai_builder_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   Install all necessary Python libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Install Docker**:

   If you want to run your project in a Docker container, you can install Docker using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install --cask docker
   ```

## Usage

Once everything is installed, you can start using AI_Builder to create and train machine learning models. The default pipeline includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Example

Here’s an example of how to get started with a basic classification task:

1. **Load your dataset** into the `data/` folder.
2. **Modify the configuration file** (located in `config/`) to set parameters such as model type, epochs, learning rate, and other hyperparameters.
3. **Run the main script**:

   ```bash
   python ai_builder_main.py
   ```

This will execute the default pipeline, which includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model creation (based on your configuration)
- Training and evaluation
- Visualizing results using Dash/Streamlit

### Customization

AI_Builder is designed to be customizable, allowing you to tailor the workflow to your specific needs. Here are some common ways to customize the pipeline:

1. **Change Model Type**: 
   Modify the configuration to switch between different machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks).
   ```python
   model_type = "neural_network"  # options: "logistic_regression", "random_forest", etc.
   ```

2. **Modify Training Parameters**:
   Update the configuration file to set parameters like batch size, learning rate, or number of epochs.
   ```python
   batch_size = 64
   learning_rate = 0.001
   epochs = 50
   ```

3. **Use Custom Datasets**:
   Replace the default dataset with your own CSV files in the `data/` folder, and make sure to adjust the preprocessing steps in the configuration.

### Deployment

You can deploy AI_Builder models in different environments, depending on your requirements:

1. **Local Deployment**:
   After training your model, you can save it locally using:
   ```python
   model.save("path/to/save/model")
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**:
   If you prefer containerized deployment, AI_Builder includes a `Dockerfile`. To deploy with Docker, build the container with:
   ```bash
   docker build -t ai_builder .
   ```
   Then, run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 ai_builder
   ```

3. **Cloud Deployment**:
   For cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure), you can export the trained model and use any cloud-based AI service to serve the model.
